      "contents": "\n\nFearless Speech\n\n\nA Virtual Reality Gaze Exposure Treatment to Reduce Fear of Public Speaking\n\n\n\n\n\nWe developed a stand-alone gaze exposure treatment in virtual reality (VR) to test the potential of reducing gaze avoidance to reduce anxiety. The gaze exposure trained the maintenance of eye contact with audiences across progressively challenging social scenarios.\n\n\nVR Gaze Exposure Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure displays a classroom (A), proximity (B), and lecture hall scenario (C) used in the gaze exposure treatment. From left to right, the social scenario increases in difficulty, with differences in audience size, proximity, and facial expressions. A green arrow indicates a target person for maintaining eye contact. After successfully holding eye contact with the target person over a predefined time as measured by gaze tracking, the arrow switched to the next target person to prompt a change of eye contact. Each level was repeated until the overall eye contact maintenance exceeded a predefined time threshold ranging from 56 to 96 seconds, depending on the level, and the user indicated low anxiety (i.e., < 3) on a state anxiety rating.\n\n\nSee here how this works…\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\n\n\nIn a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of exposure to gaze in reducing state anxiety. Eighty-nine adult participants with subclinical PSA were assigned to either a gaze exposure treatment or a control group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessments occurred at baseline, following a one-hour acute intervention (Post 1), and three to five weeks after a two-weeks home treatment (Post 2). At each assessment, participants conducted a public speaking test (PST, see below). After a baseline PST, the participants of the treatment group underwent the gaze exposure treatment in VR for 3 × 20 min, while the participants of the control group explored virtual scenarios without social content. The second PST followed the procedure as the first one. Subsequently, the treatment group completed 9 × 20 min home treatment sessions with the gaze exposure app, while the control group did not receive any task. Three to five weeks after treatment completion of the treatment group, a third public speaking test was conducted.\n\n\nPublic Speaking Test\n\n\nWe tested treatment effects in a real-life public speaking situation. The primary Outcome was state anxiety during public speaking, assessed using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale.\nThe main secondary outcome was gaze avoidance during public speaking, as measured by eye-tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure displays the view of the participant during the real-life public speaking test as recorded through a mobile eye-tracking system The public speaking test (PST) comprised ten minutes of semi-improvised speeches in front of an evaluation committee. Before the first and after every speech, participants indicated their state anxiety level on the Subjective Units of Distress Scale. During the speeches, we used eye tracking and a face detection algorithm to quantify gaze avoidance as the relative dwell time off faces of any committee members during public speaking. Here, A video frame is shown, recorded from the world camera of a mobile eye tracking system, representing a participant’s perspective during the public speaking test.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure displayes the effects of the gaze exposure treatment on state anxiety and gaze avoidance during public speaking. Linear mixed models’ analyses suggested no reduction regarding state anxiety or the relative dwell time off faces during the public speaking test in the treatment group immediately after 1-h gaze exposure (Post 1) compared to the control group. However, there was a beneficial effect on state anxiety (cohens d’ = 1.07) and gaze avoidance (cohens d’ = - 0.97) after additional home treatment (9 × 20 min), as evident by the difference between the groups one month after the intervention (Post 2).\n\n\nImplications\n\n\n• A two-week VR gaze exposure reduces state anxiety during public speaking. \n• VR gaze exposure requires no exposure to real people or any verbal interaction.\n• VR exposure apps offer accessible self-help tools at a low initiation threshold. \n\n\nPublication\n\n\nVirtual reality gaze exposure treatment reduces state anxiety during public speaking in individuals with public speaking anxiety: A randomized controlled trial @ Journal of Anxiety Disorders Reports\n\n\n\nBernhard Fehlmann1,5,\nFabian D Mueller1,5,\nNan Wang1,5,\nMerle K Ibach1,5,\nThomas Schlitt2,5,\nDorothée Bentz1,5,\nAnja Zimmer1,5,\nAndreas Papassotiropoulos2,3,4,5,\nDominique JF de Quervain1,4,5\n\nBernhard Fehlmann & Fabian D Mueller contributed equally to this work\n\n\nDivision of Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Birmannsgasse 8, Basel 4055, Switzerland\n\n\nDivision of Molecular Neuroscience, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel 4055, Switzerland\n\n\nLife Sciences Training Facility, Department Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel 4056, Switzerland\n\n\nUniversity Psychiatric Clinics, University of Basel, Basel 4002, Switzerland\n\n\nResearch Cluster Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Basel, Basel 4055, Switzerland\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\nThis work was presented at the 26th Annual CyberPsychology, CyberTherapy & Social Networking Conference\n(CYPSY26).

It is based on experimental reflexive walks and aesthetic interventions. Together with my friends, we often go for expanded sound-walks, in which we share our recent musical discoveries. Each of us puts together a short music set with his/her most recent treasure discoveries. We all press play at the exactly same time (this usually takes a few attempts — but exact synchronization is absolutely essential!), and then we walk and let the music guide our mind while enjoying the beauty of nature. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, for most patients, the onset of full-blown psychotic symptoms is preceded by subtler changes in perception, thought and beliefs, which seem to be attenuated forms of hallucinations and delusions, respectively. The question remains whether these experiences in psychosis-prone individuals are fundamentally driven by perceptual anomalies or higher-order cognitive processes.\n\n\n\nTake a closer look at Mona.

SciSmile simulates reciprocal smiling interactions using videos of smiling people. The app tracks when users smile and triggers a responsive video of a person smiling back, thereby creating positive social feedback.\n\n\nA Glimpse of the App\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Can It Effectively Reduce Stress?\n\n\nWe launched the SciSmile app on both the Android and Apple App stores in 2021 to assess its appeal and potential effectiveness in the general population. The primary focus was to determine if such an intervention could effectively reduce stress levels and elevate mood. Preliminary results from an anonymous online pilot study in Switzerland showed that a two-week training with SciSmile has strong potential for reducing stress and enhancing mood.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we could not conclude whether these beneficial effects were primarily the result of the smiling intervention or if they could be attributed to other factors such as placebo effects or regression to the mean. To get a better idea we launched a second app, SciMem, a simple smartphone memory game app. And, interestingly, we found comparable effects.\nThus, it remains to be determined what explains the beneficial effects observed in both our apps. To answer this question, we are currently conducting a three-arm RCT to test the efficacy of SciSmile and SciMem, compared to a waitlist control.\n\n\nThe Efficacy of SciSMile vs SciMem on Stress: A Three-Arm RCT\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Screenshots from the SciSmile & SciMem App. Left: SciSmile; Right: SciMem.\n\n\n\nMore information about the study coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
