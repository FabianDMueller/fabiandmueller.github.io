I am a cognitive psychologist pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the <a href="https://mcn.unibas.ch/de/">University of Basel</a>, Switzerland and <a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/cannonlab/">Yale University</a>, USA. My broad aim is to develop straightforward and scalable <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666915323001658?via%3Dihub">treatment interventions</a> for mental health, using the potential of contemporary technologies, with a focus on immersive technologies like AR and VR. 

As a personal portfolio, this website showcases my scientific and artistic projects. <br>

<!-- With a background in Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience, I am most fundamentally interested in understanding how our brains constructs our phenomenological reality. <br> To understand this, I study perceptual processing in individuals who perceive reality differently (i.e., psychosis). My approach embeds perceptual decision-making in virtual reality simulations of altered perception.  -->
