The best way to learn is to experience. This is why, I communicate our research to the broader community by creating immersive experiences. I am part of a collaborative artistic collective, focusing on creating audiovisual experiences and transforming spaces by making sound, visuals, and emotions work in unison. We produce audiovisual performances and immersive installations.


```{r}
# Load the magick package
install.packages("magick")
library(magick)

# Read in your images
image1 <- image_read("/Users/interface/Documents/GitHub/Webpage/images/3.png")
image2 <- image_read("/Users/interface/Documents/GitHub/Webpage/images/2.png")
# Add more images as needed

# Combine your images into a grid
image_grid <- image_append(c(image1, image2)) # Add more images as needed

# Write the grid image to a file
image_write(image_grid, "grid_image.png")

```
